function X_denoised = denoising_by_low_rank_factorization(W, A, X, n_components)
% 
% Denoising by low-rank factorization. Computes a low-rank approximation of
% the input data, given a set of spatial filters and corresponding spatial
% patterns. 
% 
% X_denoised = denoising_by_low_rank_factorization(W, A, X, n_components)
%
% The input data X are projected onto a subset of components using the
% filter matrix W and then this subset is backprojected using the patterns
% in A. By using only a subset of components, the data is essentially
% "denoised" without changing the dimensionality. The rank is affected
% however!
%
% Input:
% W - matrix of spatial filters (for example obtained from SSD or ICA, etc).
%         Each column is one filter.
% A - matrix of spatial patterns (for example obtained from SSD or ICA, etc).
%         Each column is one pattern.
% X - the input data, size(X) can either be [n_samples, n_channels] or 
%         [n_samples, n_channels, n_epochs]
% n_components - number of components to use from W and A
%
% Output:
% X_denoised - same format as X but containing only the first n components
%               of W and A
%
%
% See the section on low-rank factorization in Haufe et al. 2014 for more
% for more details on the approach.
